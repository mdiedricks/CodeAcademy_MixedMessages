# Mixed Messages - CodeAcademy Project

## General Information
This is the first of 5 projects set on the Back-End Development path on CodeAcademy.
It's meant to be a random quote generator, that combines phrases to create a unique output each time.
I combined nonsense from my mind to create something that would make me laugh.

It had a few minor requirements, mostly around how it was developed. 
One in particular was that it was to be run by Node.

## Technologies
* Node v14
* JavaScript

## Project Status
This is all this project will ever be.
I don't intend on expanding on it, but I might come back for a chuckle every now and then.

## Launch
No installation required. Just clone and run.

```node index.js```
